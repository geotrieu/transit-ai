# Transit AI Planner for Urban Cities

<img style="width:30%" src="https://i.imgur.com/tmwd42w.png">

Public transit systems around the world look extremely different, fitting to the needs of the locals and adapting to local geography.

Urban and city planners spend countless hours finding the optimal routes to operate different modes of transit such as busses, trams, subways, and ferries to fulfill the commuting requirements of the public. Often, this process takes years to plan and decades to execute on, all while the urban compositions and public need is ever changing. This results in building transit based on now outdated information.

Building transit for the future is more important than ever as population centers continue to grow, and road infrastructure increasingly become more congested for personal vehicles. The biggest reason why people end up buying a car instead of taking public transit is because of the inconvenience associated with using the system â€“ a symptom of poor and outdated public transit planning.

In this project, computer vision algorithms analyze different geographical information system (GIS) information and comes up with a transit system that would optimize a variety of factors.
